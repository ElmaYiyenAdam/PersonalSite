        <h1>Hi, I'm Saygın Çamsoy.</h1>
        <p>
          I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate with a strong interest in
          software development, data structures, and problem-solving. I enjoy
          building practical projects that combine clean code, thoughtful
          design, and real-world applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am currently studying Computer Engineering at METU Northern Cyprus
          Campus. My academic goal is to strengthen my foundations in software
          engineering and pursue a career focused on impactful, well-designed
          technology.
